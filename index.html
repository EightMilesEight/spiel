    <div class="card accommodations">
      <h3 class="card-header">Accommodations</h3>
      <p>
        Hopefully you've read my 504 Plan. As a result of my ADHD, I receive:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Extra time on classroom tests and quizzes</li>
        <li>Occasional check-ins to keep me on task</li>
        <li>Instructions in a step-by-step format</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I know that providing this extra support can be difficult,
        especially when multiple students in a class receive accommodations.
        If you think you might not be able to provide my accommodations,
        or if you have questions about what certain accommodations entail/
        how other teachers have handled them in past years,
        please just ask me, and I'm happy to help as much as I can.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="card social">
      <h3 class="card-header">Social Issues</h3>
      <p>
        I sometimes have trouble with social cues and conventions.
        If I'm being too loud, talking too much, or being otherwise disrespectful,
        feel free to just tell me to shut up. I promise, I won't take it the wrong way.
        I often will miss more subtle cues, and I talk a lot.
        If I'm being rude, either to you or even to someone else,
        the best way to let me know is by being direct.
        If there's something you think I'd benefit from feedback on,
        feel free to come by my seat or pull me aside after class and let me know.
      </p>

    <div class="card social">
      <h3 class="card-header">Tics</h3>
      <p>
        You might see me making weird, sometimes repetitive movements during class,
        particularly with my neck and pinky fingers. These are tics, and they're involuntary.
        If I seem to be repeatedly jerking my head in class
        (one tic that often causes people to think I'm shaking my head in disagreement),
        it's not meant to be disrespectful at all, it's just not something I can control.
        For me, tics can be exacerbated by stress, certain stimuli, or just randomly flare up.
        If you'd like to learn more about tics, you can check out

    <h2 class="section-title">A note on handwriting...</h2>
    <p>
      I have sensory issues. One of these is triggered by writing with pencils and (non-whiteboard) markers
      due to both the tactile and auditory sensations involved with using them.
      For this reason, when writing, I either use a pen or type on a computer.
      Pens aren't perfect, but they don't cause pain in the same way pencils and markers do.
      However, as you'll likely find, my handwriting usually isn't legible.
      There's five people in the world who can read my normal handwriting, including myself and my mother.
      When needed, I'm able to write semi-legibly, though it's significantly slower and still usually
      requires some help with deciphering.
      For this reason, when possible, teachers have often provided a digital copy of paper assignments.
      All this is a long-winded way to say that my handwriting is abysmal,
      and if you need help deciphering my written assignments, feel free to email me, and I'm happy to help
      translate my chicken scratch into proper english.
